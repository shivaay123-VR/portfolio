   <h1>My Favorite Websites</h1>
   <hr/>
   <h2>Original NovelWebsite</h2>
   <p>
   Novel Fire</a><br/>Website interaction is very good.It has audio book builtin option.Obviously has access to many novels,mostly has all webnovels available in the world.Hence is also the best reading hub.Comment section is present hence book recommendation can be asked as well  as we can enjoy each and every chaper together.The most suprising thing all of this is for free.The link for the website is here- <a href="https://novelfire.net/home">Link</a> </p>

   <h2>Fanfic Novel website</h2>
   <p>
    Webnovel</a><br/><br/><img src="Webnovel.jpg" alt="an image with a blue background,with N on out of W with N being in blue colour and W is in black"><br/>
    Another very good site for novels all though normal novels require payment hence they are not mostly read here unless people want to really help the author.But,still this is the best place to read fanfictions as well as translation of fanfiction which are not there in other as other sites even free ones only have normal novels but here fanfics are available.The website for the link is here- <a href="https://www.webnovel.com/">Link</a></p>
<h2>Manga Website</h2>
<p>
Mangaread</a><br/>Very good website for all types of manga user interactions are less but as it it is a good website for manga,manwha and manuha lovers.Ratings are a bit messed upp but the more a person uses the site he or she wil under stand how to judge the comics better.Mainly no ads hence its a gem.The link for the website is here- <a href="https://www.mangaread.org/">Link</a></p>
<h2>Manwha Website</h2>
<p>
Asura Scans<br/><br/><img src="asura scans.jfif"alt="Black back ground with Asura Scans written boldly but in white."><br/>Goat no words for this website will just make you speechless for manwha and few manuhas this site is goated they pick only those works which users like to read hence it is the goat of the websites in manwha community.All the Manwhas on this website are very well structured and story telling is pure peak.It is Asura what do you expect the art is just chef's kiss.Anyways if anyone wants to get into Manwha this is the site I would recommend.The website for the link is here- <a href="https://asuracomic.net/">Link</a>
</p>
<h2>Review Website</h2>
<p>
    Novel updates<br/><br/>Very very obvious thing to know is that for a novel reader.Reviewing website is very important for a reader as we cannot waste hours on a book that is not in our area of interest.If anyone wants good reviews of novels this would be the best.The Link for the webite is  here - <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/">Link.</a>
