    <h1>Vijeth.R</h1>
    <hr/>
    <P>Hi I am Vijeth.R.<br/>I’m someone who’s still figuring things out, but that’s part of the adventure. I enjoy exploring different worlds through stories, games, and ideas—whether it’s manhwa with overpowered heroes, epic fanfictions, or deep concepts from psychology and philosophy.
    </P><p></p>I like diving into details, connecting dots, and imagining “what if” scenarios that turn into creative projects. At the same time, I keep things fun and lighthearted—because life’s too short to be boring.</P>
    <p>This website is my little corner of the internet where I can share what I’m into, what I’m creating, and maybe even what I’m learning along the way.</p>
