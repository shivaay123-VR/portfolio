    <p>I’m someone who’s still figuring things out, but that’s part of the adventure. I enjoy exploring different worlds
        through stories, games, and ideas—whether it’s manhwa with overpowered heroes, epic fanfictions, or deep
        concepts from psychology and philosophy.</p>
    <p>I like diving into details, connecting dots, and imagining “what if” scenarios that turn into creative projects.
        At the same time, I keep things fun and lighthearted—because life’s too short to be boring.</p>
    <p>This website is my little corner of the internet where I can share what I’m into, what I’m creating, and maybe
        even what I’m learning along the way.</p>
