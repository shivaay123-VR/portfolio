    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>I’m Vijeth R, a curious learner with a passion for psychology, coding, and creative storytelling. I may not pick
        things up instantly, but I approach every challenge with patience, consistency, and determination. Over the past
        few years, I’ve explored storytelling through writing fanfiction, which has helped me sharpen my creativity and
        ability to engage with ideas in unique ways. I’m also building my skills in web development while studying
        psychology, aiming to connect both fields to understand people better and create meaningful experiences. With a
        positive, can-do mindset, I focus on steady growth and genuine learning</p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>As I continue to build my skills in web development, I have worked on a series of beginner-friendly projects
            that reflect my learning journey and growing expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects showcase
            my ability to create structured, visually appealing, and functional web pages while practicing core concepts
            such as layout design, styling, responsive structures, and interactivity. Each project has helped me
            understand not only the technical side of coding but also how to approach problem-solving and creativity in
            web development.</p>
