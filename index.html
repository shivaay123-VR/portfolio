    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Vijeth R, and I am someone who thrives at the intersection of two fascinating worlds:
        Psychology and Coding. While these fields may seem very different on the surface—one focused on the inner
        workings of the human mind and the other on building the logic and structure of technology—I see them as deeply
        connected. Both are about understanding systems, solving problems, and creating meaningful solutions.</p>
    <p>My journey into psychology began with a simple curiosity: Why do people think, feel, and behave the way they do?
        This curiosity soon turned into a structured pursuit of knowledge as I began studying psychology academically. I
        found myself drawn to topics such as cognitive processes, decision-making, behavior patterns, and the influence
        of environment on mental health. To me, psychology is not just about theory—it is about application. It is about
        asking: How can we use our understanding of the mind to improve lives, create healthier societies, and design
        better experiences?</p>
    <p>At the same time, I developed a strong passion for coding. Coding, to me, is more than writing lines of
        instructions—it is an act of creation. Every program, website, or application begins with an idea, and through
        logic, algorithms, and design, that idea transforms into reality. I enjoy the process of problem-solving in
        coding: breaking down complex challenges into manageable steps, experimenting with different solutions, and
        continuously learning new concepts in the ever-evolving field of technology</p>
    <p>The unique part of my journey is that I do not see psychology and coding as separate paths. Instead, I view them
        as complementary. Psychology equips me with insights into how people think, how they learn, and how they
        interact with the world. Coding gives me the tools to transform those insights into practical applications.
        Together, they allow me to build solutions that are not only technically efficient but also deeply
        human-centered.</p>
